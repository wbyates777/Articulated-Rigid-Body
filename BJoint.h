 \section joint_overview Overview
 
 The Rigid Body Dynamics Library supports a multitude of joints:
 revolute, planar, fixed, singularity-free spherical joints and joints
 with multiple degrees of freedom oint Model Calculation Routinein any combinations.
 
 Fixed joints do not cause any overhead in RBDL as the bodies that are
 rigidly connected are merged into a single body. For details see \ref
 joint_models_fixed.
 
 Joints with multiple degrees of freedom are emulated by default which
 means that they are split up into multiple single degree of freedom
 joints which results in equivalent models. This has the benefit that it
 simplifies the required algebra and also code branching in RBDL. A
 special case are joints with three degrees of freedom for which specific
 joints are available that should be used for performance reasons
 whenever possible. See \ref joint_three_dof for details.
 
 Joints are defined by their motion subspace. For each degree of freedom
 a one dimensional motion subspace is specified as a Math::SpatialVector.
 This vector follows the following convention: \f[ (r_x, r_y, r_z, t_x,
 t_y, t_z) \f]
 
 To specify a planar joint with three degrees of freedom for which the
 first two are translations in \f$x\f$ and \f$y\f$ direction and the last
 is a rotation around \f$z\f$, the following joint definition can be
 used:
 
 \code 
    Joint planar_joint = Joint (
        Math::SpatialVector (0., 0., 0., 1., 0., 0.),
        Math::SpatialVector (0., 0., 0., 0., 1., 0.),
        Math::SpatialVector (0., 0., 1., 0., 0., 0.)
    );
 \endcode
 
 \note Please note that in the Rigid %Body Dynamics Library all angles
 are specified in radians.
 
 \section joint_models_fixed Fixed Joints
 
 Fixed joints do not add an additional degree of freedom to the model.
 When adding a body that via a fixed joint (i.e. when the type is
 JointTypeFixed) then the dynamical parameters mass and inertia are
 merged onto its moving parent. By doing so fixed bodies do not add
 computational costs when performing dynamics computations.
 
 To ensure a consistent API for the Kinematics such fixed bodies have a
 different range of ids. Where as the ids start at 1 get incremented for
 each added body, fixed bodies start at Model::fixed_body_discriminator
 which has a default value of std::numeric_limits<unsigned int>::max() /
 2. This means theoretical a maximum of each 2147483646 movable and fixed
 bodies are possible.
 
 To check whether a body is connected by a fixed joint you can use the
 function Model::isFixedBodyId().
 
 \section joint_three_dof 3-DoF Joints
 
 RBDL has highly efficient implementations for the following three degree
 of freedom joints:
 <ul>
     <li>\ref JointTypeTranslationXYZ which first translates along X, then
     Y, and finally Z.</li>
     <li>\ref JointTypeEulerZYX which first rotates around Z, then Y, and
     then X.</li>
     <li>\ref JointTypeEulerXYZ which first rotates around X, then Y, and
     then Z.</li>
     <li>\ref JointTypeEulerYXZ which first rotates around Y, then X, and
     then Z.</li>
     <li>\ref JointTypeEulerZXY which first rotates around Z, then X, and
     then Y.</li>
     <li>\ref JointTypeSpherical which is a singularity free joint that
     uses a Quaternion and the bodies angular velocity (see \ref
     joint_singularities for details).</li>
 </ul>
 
 These joints can be created by providing the joint type as an argument
 to the Joint constructor, e.g.:
 
 \code Joint joint_rot_zyx = Joint ( JointTypeEulerZYX ); \endcode
 
 Using 3-Dof joints is always favourable over using their emulated
 counterparts as they are considerably faster and describe the same
 kinematics and dynamics.
 
 \section joint_floatingbase Floating-Base Joint (a.k.a. Freeflyer Joint)
 
 RBDL has a special joint type for floating-base systems that uses the
 enum JointTypeFloatingBase. The first three DoF are translations along
 X,Y, and Z. For the rotational part it uses a JointTypeSpherical joint.
 It is internally modeled by a JointTypeTranslationXYZ and a
 JointTypeSpherical joint. It is recommended to only use this joint for
 the very first body added to the model.
 
 Positional variables are translations along X, Y, and Z, and for
 rotations it uses Quaternions. To set/get the orientation use
 Model::SetQuaternion () / Model::GetQuaternion() with the body id
 returned when adding the floating base (i.e. the call to
 Model::AddBody() or Model::AppendBody()).
 
 \section joint_singularities Joint Singularities
 
 Singularities in the models arise when a joint has three rotational
 degrees of freedom and the rotations are described by Euler- or
 Cardan-angles. The singularities present in these rotation
 parametrizations (e.g. for ZYX Euler-angles for rotations where a
 +/- 90 degrees rotation around the Y-axis) may cause problems in
 dynamics calculations, such as a rank-deficit joint-space inertia matrix
 or exploding accelerations in the forward dynamics calculations.
 
 For this case RBDL has the special joint type
 RigidBodyDynamics::JointTypeSpherical. When using this joint type the
 model does not suffer from singularities, however this also results in
 a change of interpretation for the values \f$\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{\dot{q}}, \mathbf{\ddot{q}}\f$, and \f$\mathbf{\tau}\f$:
 
 <ul>
     <li> The values in \f$\mathbf{q}\f$ for the joint parameterizes the orientation of a joint using a
     Quaternion \f$q_i\f$ </li>
     <li> The values in \f$\mathbf{\dot{q}}\f$ for the joint describe the angular
     velocity \f$\omega\f$ of the joint in body coordinates</li>
     <li> The values in \f$\mathbf{\ddot{q}}\f$ for the joint describe the angular
     acceleration \f$\dot{\omega}\f$ of the joint in body coordinates</li>
     <li> The values in \f$\mathbf{\tau}\f$ for the joint describe the three couples
     acting on the body in body coordinates that are actuated by the joint.</li>
 </ul>
 
 As a result, the dimension of the vector \f$\mathbf{q}\f$ is higher than
 of the vector of the velocity variables. Additionally, the values in
 \f$\mathbf{\dot{q}}\f$ are \b not the derivative of \f$q\f$ and are therefore
 denoted by \f$\mathbf{\bar{q}}\f$ (and similarly for the joint
 accelerations).
 
 RBDL stores the Quaternions in \f$\mathbf{q}\f$ such that the 4th component of
 the joint is appended to \f$\mathbf{q}\f$. E.g. for a model with the joints:
 TX, Spherical, TY, Spherical, the values of \f$\mathbf{q},\mathbf{\bar{q}},\mathbf{\bar{\bar{q}}},\mathbf{\tau}\f$ are:
 
 
 \f{eqnarray*}
 \mathbf{q} &=& ( q_{tx}, q_{q1,x}, q_{q1,y}, q_{q1,z}, q_{ty}, q_{q2,x}, q_{q2,y}, q_{q2,z}, q_{q1,w}, q_{q2,w})^T \\
 \mathbf{\bar{q}} &=& ( \dot{q}_{tx}, \omega_{1,x}, \omega_{1,y}, \omega_{1,z}, \dot{q}_{ty}, \omega_{2,x}, \omega_{2,y}, \omega_{2,z} )^T \\
 \mathbf{\bar{\bar{q}}} &=& ( \ddot{q}_{tx}, \dot{\omega}_{1,x}, \dot{\omega}_{1,y}, \dot{\omega}_{1,z}, \ddot{q}_{ty}, \dot{\omega}_{2,x}, \dot{\omega}_{2,y}, \dot{\omega}_{2,z} )^T \\
 \mathbf{\tau} &=& ( \tau_{tx}, \tau_{1,x}, \tau_{1,y}, \tau_{1,z}, \tau_{ty}, \tau_{2,x}, \tau_{2,y}, \tau_{2,z} )^T
 \f}
 
 \subsection spherical_integration Numerical Integration of Quaternions
 
 An additional consequence of this is, that special treatment is required
 when numerically integrating the angular velocities. One possibility is
 to interpret the angular velocity as an axis-angle pair scaled by the
 timestep and use it create a quaternion that is applied to the previous
 Quaternion. Another is to compute the quaternion rates from the angular
 velocity. For details see James Diebel "Representing Attitude: Euler
 Angles, Unit Quaternions, and Rotation Vectors", 2006,
