 History:

 Algorithms for calculating the forward and inverse dynamics of a kinematic tree.
 
 Trees (and chains) of kinematic equations are used in robotics, computer games, and animation.
 In robotics {\it forward kinematics} refers to the use of kinematic equations to compute the position of 
 an end-effector, such as a jointed robotic arm, from specified values for the joint parameters.
 
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_kinematics
 
 The reverse calculation, that computes the joint parameters that achieve a specified arm position, 
 is known as {\it inverse kinematics}.

 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_kinematics

 BDynamics is an implementation of 
 i) the articulated-body algorithm (ABA) and  
 ii) the recursive Newton-Euler algorithm (RNEA), 
 presented in: 
 "Rigid Body Dynamics Algorithms" (RBDA), R. Featherstone, Springer, 2008 (see https://royfeatherstone.org). 
 
 ABA is an example of a propagation algorithm, and it is the fastest known algorithm
 for calculating the forward dynamics of a kinematic tree with a computational complexity of $O(N_B)$,
 where $N_B$ is the number of bodies/joints. 
 This is the theoretical minimum for solving the forward dynamics problem (see RBDA, Section 7.3). 
 
 RNEA calculate the inverse dynamics of a kinematic tree. 
 It is the simplest, most efficient known algorithm for trees, and also has a computational complexity 
 of $O(N_B)$ (see RBDA, Section 5.3). 
 
 The implementations presented here are based on those in the RBDL library ( see https://github.com/rbdl/rbdl ).
 
 The implemenations here do NOT depend on Eigen3, instead they depend soly on the 
 GLM linear algebra library ( see https://github.com/g-truc/glm ).
  
 It should be relatively straightforward to convert back to Eigen3 (although see 
 the note on Eigen3 and GLM differences), or  replace GLM with some other simple
 linear algebra library.
